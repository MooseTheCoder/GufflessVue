# Guffless Vue

Okay, so, I love Vue.Js, it is one of the greatest things I have seen done with Javascript. Its simple and its powerful.

The only issue I have with it is the effort needed to use single file components, all the guff that you need to set up and configure, never mind adding it into an existing project without spending some time in the documentation.

This repo is a simple set of files and folders that will allow you to start using Vue.JS single file components in a matter of minutes.

This only covers the basic Vue.Js environment. No router or anything else, just webpack and Vue.

Using nodemon with this template can be pretty useful.

`nodemon --ext js,vue,css --ignore dist --exec "webpack --config webpack.config.js"`
